This a first draft if Inter-Kernel Communication for POE.  It is intended
as a point of reference for discusion of issues involved.  

As "Mythical Man Month" says : Plan to throw one away.


You will need the latest version of POE.  IKC has a sneaky way of
discovering bugs and lacunae in POE :)


Quick test :
perl Makefile.PL
make
./server & ./client
... and wait 

Better yet, run ./server and ./client in seperate windows.  ./client should
output a . every 10 seconds.  Running many clients will give you an idea of
the overhead :)

STABILITY 

I use IKC full time on my sites (for example, http://www.camelot.ca/) so I'd
say it is "stable enough if you know what you're doing", even if it doesn't
implement my full original vision.  I use IKC::ClientLite in mod_perl to
talk to POE-based "application servers".
