This a first draft if Inter-Kernel Communication for POE.  It is intended
as a point of reference for discusion of issues involved.  

As "Mythical Man Month" says : Plan to throw one away.

You will need to patch POE 0.06_06 with the included patch for this to work.
Order of patching :
philip_gwyn-set_filter-3.patch
philip_gwyn-ref_filter_type-1.patch
philip_gwyn-kr_ses_IDs.2.patch


Quick test :
perl Makefile.PL
make
./server & ./client
... and wait 

Better yet, run ./server and ./client in seperate windows.  ./client should
output a . every 10 seconds.  Running many clients will give you an idea of
the overhead :)

IKC probably isn't worth a make install this just yet.
