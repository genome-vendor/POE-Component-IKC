Revision history for Perl extension POE::Component::IKC.

0.13  13 July 2001
    - Added and repaired serializer selection for clients
    - Added doco for ClientLite
    - Sungo is happy with this release... onto CPAN it goes.

0.13pre9  5 July 2001
    - Doco fixes

0.13pre8  4 July 2001
    - Fixed the deprecated use of defined(@array) in IKC/Responder.pm
    - Added doco about SENDER
    - create_ikc_channel now takes an arrayref of aliases, 
      so that IKC::Client and IKC::Server can accept a longer list of
      pre-defined names.
    - IKC/post2 now expects SENDER to come before [state, args]
    - Added doco to the effect that callback states are temporarily published
    - Updated code that turned off the socket_factory... Dngor had
      changed SocketFactory's implementation on me!  This is what you get
      for doing bad stuff.

0.13pre7  20 June 2001
    - Added IKC/published, for sungo
    - Fixed doco a bit
    - Added a prereq for POE 0.1403

0.13pre6  6 June 2001
    - ADDED TESTS!
        Woot woot!  Now make test verifies something meaningful.
    - No longer thunking sessions that don't publish any states
    - Finally did unsubscribe... turns out retract was available all along
    - Added IKC::{Client,Proxy,Responder,Server}->spawn method, to 
        be used in favour of create_ikc_*mumble*
    - Added IKC/post2 .... internal use only
    - Added FlushedState handler to IKC::Channel.  This way, wheel isn't
        destroyed until all data is flushed.  This means you can post
        events to remote kernels and then IKC/shutdown right away.  I hope.

0.13pre5  4 June 2001
    - Added IKC/shutdown and attendant bouffonery (see shut-{server,client})
    - IKC::Proxy for 'poe://somekernel/somesession' is now also aliased
      as 'somesession'
    - Added unix-domain sockets... don't know if i've got this right
        see u{server,client}

0.13pre2-4  May 2001
    - Fixed doco and monitor stuff

0.13pre1 19 Apr 2001

0.12  March 2001
    - Updated Changes, README.  Added FUTUR
    - Improved warning messages
    - IKC::ClientLite::disconnect no longer calls IKC/unregister to remote
      (doing it was unneed, server does it automatically when socket dies)

0.11  Nov 16 2000
    - IKC/ClientLite now sets $/ and $\ to "\r\n"
    - wantarray() now gets propagated... is this tested?
    - babysitting now knows of "defunct" children
    - children now turn off SIGCHLD and SIGINT... dunce :)
